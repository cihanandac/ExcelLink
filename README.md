A program to give automatic hyperlinks and thumbnails to an excel file

As a museum professional, I often need to create big excel files with photos and thumbnails. Adding photos
to a big file with thousands of raws make it so big and slow. I found the solution in creating hyperlinks 
of the photos.

Program will automaticaly give a link to a photo. It will search a column of your choice sheet by sheet 
and if it finds any match in photo pools location, link will be given to cell of your choice.

Don't seperate the photo pool folder with the excel afterwards or the links won't work.

Feel free to use and share.
